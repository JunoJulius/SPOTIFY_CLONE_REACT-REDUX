# Spotify Clone React Redux

You'll make a page to manage your playlists with different songs.

## Requirements

* a user should be able to add a playlist (with just a name)

* there should be a list of playlists, you can select a playlist by clicking on it

* when you select a playlist, you will see all the songs on that playlist

* you can add songs to the playlist using a form, every song has:

	* a title
	* an artist
	* an album

A song is always just on one playlist. If you select a playlist, you only see songs from that playlist, not from another.


### Bonus

* a user can click on a button 'artists' to see a list of artists. When you click an artist, you will be able to see all the songs (from the different playlists) that are by that artist
* a user can move a song from one playlist to another
